# What is a micro-service architecture pattern

It is an approach to software development where the project is composed of small independent services (managed by (typically small) independent teams) that communicate via APIs.

  <summary>What is an API</summary>
  ## Application programming interface
  
  A a mechanism that enables two software components to communicate via a well defined set of definitions and protocols.

  **Application** stands for any software with a distinct function
  **Interface** is the set of definitions and protocols, i.e., how two components are contracted to communicate with eachother using requests and responses

  They are useful as a means of abstraction, as they allow a developer to use features/data from a service, application, or platform without any knowledge of the system.
  And since programs communicate via an API, when the programs are further developed the changes should not impact the API, this makes maintenance easier.
